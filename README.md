## Chromebook setup (exact commands)

Run these commands in your Chromebook Linux Terminal **one by one**.

### 0) If your folder is empty, reset it first

```bash
cd ~
rm -rf ~/adam1
git clone https://github.com/adamrusso1008/adam1.git ~/adam1
cd ~/adam1
ls
```

You should see files like `README.md`, `app.py`, and `requirements.txt`. If `ls` is empty, you are still in the wrong folder.
